# Quantitative Financial Analytics: Decoding Stock Returns Through Earnings, Macro, and Sentiment Analysis

### üìã Project Brief

This project conducted an in-depth analysis of stock market behaviour for major tech companies (Apple, Google, and NVIDIA) to identify opportunities for trading strategies around earnings announcements. Using Python, advanced statistical methods, and machine learning, our team delivered actionable insights that can drive enhanced trading decision-making by understanding the relationships between stock price movements, earnings announcements, macroeconomic conditions, and news sentiment.

### üéØ Business Objectives

The analysis addressed key business needs:

- Understanding stock price movements before and after earnings announcements
- Identifying the impact of key financial metrics on stock performance
- Analysing macroeconomic influences on earnings outcomes and stock prices
- Determining the role of news sentiment in market reactions

### üóùÔ∏è Key Insights and Results

#### Earnings Analysis

- EPS Surprise positively correlates with post-announcement returns (correlation ~0.3)
- Market reaction to surprises **strongest within 2-3 days** after announcement
- **Pre-announcement momentum** (BOP) shows positive correlation with post-announcement returns

#### Macroeconomic Analysis

Each company showed unique macro sensitivity profiles:

| Company | Primary Macro Correlations |
|---------|----------------------------|
| **Apple**   | Federal Debt, Real GDP     |
| **Google**  | Real GDP, CPI, Treasury Yields |
| **Nvidia**  | Real GDP, Treasury Yields, Unemployment |

**Revenue growth** consistently showed **stronger impact** on returns *than* **macroeconomic factors** for these high-growth tech companies.

#### Sentiment Analysis

News sentiment analysis revealed distinct patterns:

| Company | Sentiment Response Pattern |
|---------|----------------------------|
| **Apple**   | Recovers from negative news within 3 days; positive drift otherwise (~1% in 5 days) |
| **Google**  | Most stable to sentiment (returns within 1% window); acts as safe-haven during macro uncertainty |
| **Nvidia**  | Highest sentiment sensitivity (¬±2-3% fluctuations); strong positive reaction to macro negativity |

Pre-earnings sentiment shows consistent optimistic bias with post-announcement sentiment typically declining.

#### Trading Strategy Performance

| Company | Avg. Return per Deal | Max Drawdown | Cumulative Return | Precision |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| AAPL    | 6.5%                | -14.8%       | >20x (51 periods) | 83.3%     |
| GOOGL   | 8.0%                | 0.0%         | >20x (39 periods) | 95.0%     |
| NVDA    | 12.7%               | -6.9%        | ~700% (39 periods)| 88.9%     |


### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

The analysis was implemented using:

- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn,StatsModels,
- **ML Models**: RandomForest, OLS, Binary and Multinomial Logistic Regression
- **NLP**: FinBERT, TextBlob
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

### üìä Recommendations

#### Trading Strategy Recommendations

1. **Implement Stock-Specific Models**: Different threshold parameters for each stock (¬±2% for AAPL, ¬±5% for GOOGL/NVDA)
2. **Focus on Key Indicators**: 
   - EPS and Revenue Surprises (all stocks)
   - Pre-announcement BOP momentum
   - Company-specific financial metrics (profitability metrics for B2B stocks)
3. **Time-Window Optimization**: 2-day trading window for GOOGL/NVDA, 5-day for AAPL
4. **Risk Management**: Set tighter stop-loss for NVDA due to higher volatility
5. **Sentiment Integration**: Use as supplementary signal, particularly for NVDA

#### Technical Recommendations

1. **Model Validation**: Implement out-of-sample testing across diverse market conditions
2. **Ensemble Approaches**: Test combining multiple models for signal generation
3. **Feature Refinement**: Further customize feature importance by stock
4. **Continuous Learning**: Establish monitoring system to adapt to evolving market dynamics
